# Star Wars Explorer

The Star Wars Explorer is an app created to practise my knowledge related to React, React Hooks and React Router. The Routes were setup for three pages, including: People, Movies and Planets. The data is fetched by the [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) library using the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
