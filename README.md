# Star Wars Explorer

The Star Wars Explorer is an app created to practise my knowledge related to React, React Hooks and React Router. The Routes were setup for three pages, including: People, Movies and Planets. The data is fetched by the [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) library using the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
